Weight Training Calculus (WTC)
==============================

Introduction
============

The weight training calculus has two design premises:

* Make data entry simple
* Store the information in a manner which is easily acceptable for data analysis 

When the athlete is training, the focus is on the training.  While the routine may (and should) be published, many
participants often take quick notes rather than spend a lot of time entering data in an app.   For example, suppose the
trainee is doing a 5 set of 5 bench presses at 135 pounds.  A simple notation could be:

Bench Press 5x5 @ 135

This notation is sucinct, and requires little effort to reord.  However, in a long term training strategy, there is
addtional information to be gleaned:

Total volume lifted:  $\Sigma (r x w )$

Average reps

Average weight
